## About framework

Beautiful, but heavy. Offers integration for own push service, which may be an advantage for some. Heavily AngularJS-oriented, which may be a disadvantage for some. Includes a web-based simple IDE or drag-n-drop application creation (Creator). Nice colors, a lot of widgets, integrated fluid grid system. Has own icons system (Ionicons).

## Important notices

This project can be tested directly in browser with using [Ripple Emulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ripple-emulator-beta/geelfhphabnejjhdalkjhgipohgpdnoc?hl=en). However, project itself is written using [newest PhoneGap API](http://docs.phonegap.com/en), while Ripple Emulator has very old [2.0.0 API](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.0.0/index.html) behind. Thus, _some parts of this demo will not work in desktop computer browser_. You have to compile it and test it on mobile device, if you want to see all implemented things in action.
